# Scrolling Screen
 * Use `Ctrl-E` to scroll window content without moving cursor
```vim
Ctrl+E
or
<C-E>
```
This scrolls **one line up** *(moving the window down)* even when the cursor is at the bottom. It does not move the cursor. Press `Ctrl-E` or `<C-E>` multiple times to scroll up more lines.
# Movement by Screens

 * ^B (Ctrl + B) - Scroll backward one screen.
 * ^D (Ctrl + D) - Scroll forward half scrren (down).
 * ^U (Ctrl + U) - Scroll backward half scrren (up).
