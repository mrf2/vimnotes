# Vim Registers info

## The contents of all registers
```bash
   :reg
```
   - This will display the contents of all registers
## Registers are where Vim stores:
 - Yanked (copied) text
 - Deleted text
 - Recorded macros
 - The unnamed registers (`"`)
 - Number registers (`"0` to `"9`)

## Pasting the contents of a specified regrster
 - In insert mode press `Ctrl+r` and a double quote(`"`) will display
 - Now enter the regiser name, like, `3` which actually display like `"3`
 - Now the register will shown in buffere.
