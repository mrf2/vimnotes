# Creating a New Buffer for Another File
## 1. Open a new buffer and name it immediately
```bash
:edit new_file.txt
```
- Opens `new_file.txt` in the current window.
- If the file doesn't exist, Vim prepares a new buffer for it.

## 2. Open a new buffer in a split
### Horizontal split:
```bash
:split newfile.txt
```

### Vertical split:
```bash
:vsplit newfile.txt
```

## 3. Open a new buffer in a new tab
```bash
:tabedit newfile.txt
```

## 4. Switching Between Bufferes
Once we have multiple buffers:

### List all buffers:
```bash
:ls
```
(or `:buffers`)

### Switch to buffer #2 (for example):
```bash
:buffer 2
```

### Use previous/next buffer:
```bash
:bp - previous buffer
:pn - next buffer
```
